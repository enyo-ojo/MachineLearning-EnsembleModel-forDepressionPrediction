# 💊 Mental Health Prediction - Ensemble Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict mental health risk factors based on anonymized survey data. It was developed for the Kaggle Playground Series S4E11 challenge.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Mental health challenges are often underreported and underdiagnosed. The goal of this project was to use historical behavioral and demographic data to predict individuals at higher risk for mental health struggles—enabling early intervention.

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology
- Cleaned and imputed missing values using statistical modeling
- Performed EDA to identify patterns and outliers
- Engineered categorical and numerical features
- Trained multiple models: Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression
- Combined them using ensemble voting techniques
- Used SMOTE to address data imbalance

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, SMOTE, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **94% model accuracy**
- Improved generalizability and recall on minority class using SMOTE
- Visualized feature importance to interpret model decisions

## 💡 What I Learned
- Improved my understanding of ensemble methods and voting classifiers
- Gained hands-on experience balancing imbalanced datasets
- Enhanced feature selection and cross-validation practices

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
- Integrate SHAP values for explainability
- Incorporate more behavioral data if available
